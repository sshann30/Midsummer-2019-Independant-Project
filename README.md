1. scrape an API for data via python (newest language I'm learning, open to suggestions) 

2. paste that information into a sql database (possibly PostgreSQL or suggestion of better SQL application) 

3. transpose that scraped information from the sql tables into separate tables (my stats vs. pro stats) in a react site using material ui

Step 1: 

- [ ] pick an API

        https://github.com/mkreiser/ESPN-Fantasy-Football-API
        http://espn-fantasy-football-api.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/


- [ ] pick languages. Python? SQL? PostgreSQL?

Step 3:

my stats
| stat1    | stat 2          | stat3   |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| stats go here     | stats go here  | 1600 |
| stats go here      | stats go here       |   12 |
| stats go here  | stats go here       |    1 |


other's stats
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | stats go here  | 1600 |
| stats go here      | stats go here       |   12 |
| stats go here  | stats go here       |    1 |
